# TODO

## missing features that are already implemented in V1

- animation concept for display: none
- callbacks
- scroll
- compliance-methods like (play, reverse, pause, cancel, finish, commitStyles, updatePlaybackRate)
- filtering of unchanged elements => is this even faster?
- proper text calculations

## features to add

- how to handle addition/Deletion of elements?
- borderRadius will still be a problem
- keep alive => avoid cleanup after completion
-

## Bugs and inconsistencies

- `delay: start, duration: end, endDelay` is often used but maybe `activeTime` and `endTime` could simplify things
