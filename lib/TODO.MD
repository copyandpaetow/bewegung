# TODOs

## animation options in the config file

- iterations
- direction?

## update docs

## root handling

- if the root element is removed, its absolute position might lead to bugs because we dont know the next anchor parent
  => maybe we would need to change the code in a way that the parent is the first non-animation element

## test

- iterations
- can clip-path pass through?
- other media elements like video
- transform-origin
- filter
- pseudo-elements
- transformOrigin on display none

## Questions

## Maybes

- helper functions for

  - apply css

- logic to allow unperformant entries to pass through, like color etc
